### When should I cite my code?
 - According to the Academic Integrity at MIT guidelines for writing code, you should cite your code when:
 - You directly copy any length of code from an external resource
 - You “paraphrase” or slightly modify code that you copy from an external resource
### How do I cite my code?
#### Academic Integrity at MIT also provides some tips on how to cite your code from another source:
 - Always include the URL and date of retrieval. You may consider including additional details to clarify the source.
 - For modified code, include phrases such as “Based on:” or “Adapted from:”
 - Ask your teacher for specifications to ensure you are following proper formatting and meeting all class requirements
